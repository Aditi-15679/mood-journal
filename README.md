# 🌙 SoulPages – Simple Mood Journal (Console App)

*SoulPages* is a small and personal mood journal built using basic Python. It lets you write daily thoughts and select how you're feeling, and it saves everything to a file on your computer.

I made this to practice file handling and dictionaries in Python, while also building something meaningful I could use every day.
